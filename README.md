### Overview
Nomadic Gardens is a full-stack web application written in Java. 
Data is persisted (using JPA & MySQL) into a database that is spun up on an
AWS server. More information about the technologies used can be found toward bottom of the page.

Nomadic Gardens ties local community gardens together allowing the users to showoff their goods, as well as trade & barter for goods with other community garden users. As of now, we are tying gardens together in the Denver area.
